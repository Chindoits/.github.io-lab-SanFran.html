        <strong> San Francisco: The best and the worst </strong> 
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
        The best neighborhood is The Mission.
    </h2>
    <p> It's the neighborhood that raised me. <em> Mostly </em> outer Mission. </p>
    
    <h2> 
       The worse neighborhood is The Marina.
    </h2>
        <p> A bunch of implants from the midwest whom are techies and think they rule the world. They <strong> pretend </strong> to know the city like they know the Marina, although they dont appreciate the people that are <strong> <em> actually</em> </strong> from SF and helped build it.
